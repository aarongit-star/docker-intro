# 课堂笔记
## GOAL of this class
 Setup Jenkins CI pipeline
## 1 CI / CD
### 1.1 Continuous Integration(CI)
Continuous Integration is a practice where development teams frequently commit
application code changes to a shared repository. These changes automatically
trigger new builds which are then validated by automated testing to ensure that
they do not break any functionality

- Software build tools

- Traditional way of testing

- Automated testing

- benefits of automated testing

- relative cost of fixing defects in different stage of software developement

- Testing Pyramid

- Testing process

### 1.2 Continuous Delivery (CD)
CD is also used to describe Continuous Deployment which focuses on the
automation process to release what is now a fully functional build into production.

- Deployment

## 2 Benefits of CI/CD
1. Smaller Code Changes
2. FaultIsolations
3. Faster Mean TimeToResolution (MTTR)
4. MoreTestReliability
5. FasterRelease Rate
6. Smaller Backlog
7. CustomerSatisfaction
8. IncreaseTeamTransparency andAccountability
9. Reduce Costs
10. Easy Maintenance andUpdates

## 3 CI/CD Tools

Some big companys build their own tools for internal use.

## 4 Jenkins History
  The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
- 2004 - Kohsuke Kawaguchi created Hudson in
  Sun Microsystem
- 2005 - Hudson is released
- 2011 - Hudson renamed to Jenkins after Oracle
  purchased Sun Microsystem
- 2010 - CloudBees is created
- 2014 - CloudBees shifts focus to Enterprise
  Jenkins and provide commercial support to Jenkins.
- 2014 - Kawaguchi becomes CTO of CloudBees
## 5 Jenkins Core Concept
  ![Core Concept](image/c0612.png)

    Jenkins Job
    Jenkins Build
    Jenkins Plugin
    Jenkins View (Dashboard View)
    Jenkins Node: Master/Agent
    Jenkins Credential
    Jenkins Configuration
    Jenkins Logs
    Jenkins SSO and Global Security
    Jenkins Pipeline


## 6 Jenkins Pipeline
What is Jenkins Pipeline?

Jenkins Pipeline is a combination of plugins that supports integration and implementation of continuous delivery pipelines. It has an extensible automation server to create simple and complex delivery pipelines as code via pipeline DSL. A Pipeline is a group of events interlinked with each other in a sequence.

- Jenkins 有两类config.xml
  
  在Jenkins home之下的config.xml是Jenkins server的配置文件。
  另外在每个job或project自己的目录下，还有一个config.xml。它包含了是这个job的配置信息。

- Jekinsfile

  Jenkins pipelines can be defined using a text file called JenkinsFile. You can implement pipeline as code using JenkinsFile, and this can be defined by using a domain specific language (DSL). With JenkinsFile, you can write the steps needed for running a Jenkins pipeline.

## 7 Jenkins Configuration Management
We configured Github Pipeline and Plugins manually in Jenkins. This should be
automated.
There are a few ways to automate this.
1. Dockerise Jenkins and add the configuration into Dockerfile - https://github.com/
jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md
2. Use configuration management tool to configure Jenkins
Jenkins doesn’t use any database and uses plain file system. We should backup
Jenkins configuration files and logs as well.
There are also a few ways.
1. Use backup plugins to backup
2. Backup file system regularly
## 8 Install a Jenkins Server
- Common options to install Jenkins
  1. Official - https://jenkins.io - java -jar jenkins.war
  2. Docker - https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/
  3. Kubernetes: for large scale paralell tasks
      - Kubernetes application
      - helm
        
        helm install --name jenkins stable/jenkins --set rbac.install=true \
        --set Persistence.Enabled=true \
        --set Persistence.StorageClass=jenkins-pv
  4. Configuration Management Tool: Chef, Puppet,Ansible or Saltstack
  5. Use Jenkins in the Cloud: CloudBees, bitnami

- Hands-on:install Jenkins in docker locally

  repo:  https://github.com/sean4wsome/jrcms
  - Handson 1 - Jenkins installation:
